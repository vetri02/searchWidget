# Search Widget

Search Widget with multiselect

## Setup

Run `npm install` to set things up.

If that doesn't work, it may be necessary to use `sudo npm install`.

With this set up, you should now be able to run:

    gulp

This will process any Sass (SCSS) files, translate ES6 to ES5 and launch a web browser showing the current files. Making changes to the files should result in the page updating automatically.

## Libraries/Frameworks

- jQuery (DOM Manipulation)
- Lodash (Utilities)

## Assumptions

- User might not go in and edit the already selected value inbetween
